Dear Mom,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. It has been a while since I last wrote to you, and I miss you dearly. I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for all that you have done for me.

You have always been there for me, supporting me through every challenge and celebrating every success. Your love and guidance have been a constant presence in my life, and I am so grateful for that.

I know that I haven't always been the easiest child to raise, but you have never given up on me. You have taught me the importance of hard work, perseverance, and kindness. You have shown me what it means to be a good person, and I strim to make you proud every day.

As I go through life, I realize more and more just how much you have sacrificed for me. You have put your own dreams and aspirations on hold to make sure that I had every opportunity to succeed. You have worked tirelessly to provide for me, and I will never forget that.

I want you to know that I see you, and I appreciate you. You are an amazing woman, and I am so lucky to have you as my mom. I promise to always make you proud, and to never take your love and support for granted.

Thank you, Mom, for everything. I love you more than words can express.

Sincerely,
Devarsh Patel
