Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a letter rap song on global warming:

Verse 1:
Yo, it's Devarsh Patel, here to send a letter
About global warming, it's getting hotter and hotter
The Earth's getting warmer, it's a fact we can't ignore
We need to take action, before it's too late, that's for sure

Chorus:
Global warming, it's a real problem
We need to solve it, before it's too late
Let's come together, and make a change
Before it's too late, before it's too strange

Verse 2:
The ice caps are melting, the sea levels are rising
Animals are losing their homes, it's not surprising
The weather's getting wild, storms and droughts are increasing
We need to act now, before it's too deceasing

Chorus:
Global warming, it's a real problem
We need to solve it, before it's too late
Let's come together, and make a change
Before it's too late, before it's too strange

Verse 3:
We can make a difference, with small changes each day
Turn off the lights, when you're not in the room, it's okay
Use public transportation, or ride a bike instead
Reduce your carbon footprint, and help save the dead

Chorus:
Global warming, it's a real problem
We need to solve it, before it's too late
Let's come together, and make a change
Before it's too late, before it's too strange

Verse 4:
We can make a change, with our voices and our actions
Let's spread the word, and start a revolution
Together we can make a difference, it's not too late
Let's act now, and save the planet, before it's too late

Chorus:
Global warming, it's a real problem
We need to solve it, before it's too late
Let's come together, and make a change
Before it's too late, before it's too strange

Outro:
So let's act now, and make a change
Before it's too late, before it's too strange
Global warming, it's a real problem
We need to solve it, before it's too late.
